# Elasticsearch Java client sample

This samples shows how to interact with an Elasticsearch cluster.

The code is compatible with Elasticsearch **7.4.x**

There are 4 test classes :

- `ElasticsearchAdminTest` & `ElasticsearchDocumentTest` show the deprecated way of integrating with Elasticsearch.  
- `ElasticsearchNewVersionAdminTest` & `ElasticsearchNewVersionDocumentTest` show the new way of integrating with Elasticsearch.

## Notes
Theses examples don't aim to show you how to test an application backed by an Elasticsearch cluster, but to show how you can interact with it.
Also, it's not intended to show a proper way to test an application in general.
